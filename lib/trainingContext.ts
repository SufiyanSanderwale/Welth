  // Overview
  `Welcome to Welth! Track accounts, add transactions, analyze dashboards, set budgets, and ask an AI assistant for help. Main Menu: Dashboard · Accounts · Transactions · Budgeting · Export · AI Chatbot · Training Book.`,

  // Accounts
  `Accounts: Each transaction belongs to an account. Set a default account (Accounts page) so it pre-selects during Add Transaction. Account pages show balance, chart, and a full transaction table.`,

  // Add Transactions
  `Add Transactions: Go to Transactions → Add Transaction. Fields: type (INCOME/EXPENSE), amount, account, category, date, description. Submit to save. Use the header “Add Transaction” button for quick access.`,

  // Categories & Budgeting
  `Budgeting & Categories: On the Budgeting page, add monthly category limits and track spent vs limit. Categories are case-insensitive; keep naming consistent for cleaner charts.`,

  // Dashboard
  `Dashboard: Contains Recent Transactions and Monthly Expense Breakdown. Use the account selector to switch views. The pie chart groups expenses by normalized category (e.g., Education and education are merged).`,

  // Analytics by Chatbot
  `AI Analytics: The chatbot can compute “this month’s spend”, “income vs expense”, and “top categories”. It uses server-side accurate aggregates and responds in your chosen currency.`,

  // App Help via Chatbot
  `App Help: Ask the chatbot “How do I use the app?”, “How to add a transaction?”, “How to export?”, “Where is the dashboard?”—it answers from this Training Book.`,

  // Export
  `Export: Go to Export. Choose account and date range (last 30/6 months/custom). Click Export CSV or Export Excel to download a statement with a running balance column.`,

  // Currency
  `Currency: The app formats numbers using your profile currency. The chatbot answers using your symbol (₹, $, €).`,

  // Privacy & Tips
  `Privacy & Tips: Data stays in your account. Review transactions regularly. Keep categories consistent. Use Export for backups or sharing with your accountant.`,
